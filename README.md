# Lawrence-Style-Checker
## Basic Description
A style checking library, built in Java. The object can be used as a style checker in a similar way spelling or grammar checkers are used. 

This program is similar to the Hemingway App. It identifies flabby sentences and categorizes them into three levels: flabby, needs toning, and good. It is up to a GUI to display the results. The GUI could display flabby as red, and 'needs toning' as orange. 

I created a new way to count syllables, using a dictionary method. This is more accurate than just relying on an algorithm to count syllables. Feel free to copy my syllables.txt file. 

Feel free to use this program to create a style checker. This program does not include a GUI or an 'on the fly' writing buffer. Yet I will create a GUI for this library in the near future.
